# Exploratory data analysis of apps on iOS app store
The dataset contains information about more than 7000 iOS mobile applications, including user rate, price, genre, etc, extracted from the iTunes Search API at the Apple Inc website in July 2017. I did this exploratory data analysis in R and answered questions about the relationships of the app price, rating, genres. 

I also made a poster for the result of this analysis. Check this out:
